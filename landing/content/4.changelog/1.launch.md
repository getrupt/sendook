🚀 We're excited to announce the launch of Sendook! This milestone represents months of building, testing, and learning from developers building AI agents. Our mission: eliminate the painful complexity of email infrastructure so you can focus on building intelligence.

Every AI agent we talked to had the same frustration: setting up email took days of configuration, OAuth flows, and MIME parsing. We built Sendook to make this instant. One API call, and your agent has a working inbox. 💡

**Launch Features:**
- ⚡ **Instant Inbox Creation**: One API call creates a fully functional mailbox
- 🔔 **Real-time Webhooks**: Get notified the moment emails arrive
- 📧 **JSON-Ready Emails**: Pre-decoded, formatted, ready for your agent
- 📤 **Send & Reply**: Simple APIs for outbound email and threading
- 🔍 **Full-Text Search**: Query any email by any field, instantly
- 🔐 **Secure by Default**: API key authentication, webhook signature verification
- 📚 **Complete Documentation**: Guides, examples, and SDK reference
- 🌐 **Open Source**: MIT licensed, self-host or use our cloud

**Built for Production:** 🛠️
We run on battle-tested email infrastructure with spam filtering, deliverability optimization, and redundant systems. Automated testing and continuous deployment ensure reliability. Your AI agents deserve infrastructure they can depend on.

This is just the beginning. We're building the email platform AI agents need to communicate at scale. Let us know what you'd like to see next! ✨
