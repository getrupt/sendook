🔌 This release supercharges how your AI agents interact with email events! We've expanded webhook capabilities, launched our Python SDK, and made error handling much more robust.

Based on feedback from teams building production AI agents, we focused on visibility, reliability, and multi-language support. These improvements make your agents more responsive and easier to debug. 🗂️

**New Features:**
- 📬 **Enhanced Webhook Events:** Track `message.delivered`, `message.bounced`, `message.opened`, and `message.clicked`
- 🐍 **Python SDK:** Official Python support with type hints, async support, and idiomatic APIs
- 🔒 **Webhook Signature Verification:** Built-in helpers to verify webhook authenticity
- 🚨 **Improved Error Codes:** More granular error codes for better error handling
- 📊 **Delivery Status Tracking:** Query delivery status for any sent email
- ⚡ **Retry Logic:** Configurable webhook retry with exponential backoff
- 🔗 **Thread Context in Webhooks:** Full thread history included in `message.received` events

**Python SDK Example:**
```python
from sendook import Sendook
import asyncio

client = Sendook(api_key='your-api-key')

# Create inbox
inbox = await client.inboxes.create(name='AI Support Agent')

# Send email
await client.messages.send(
    inbox_id=inbox.id,
    to='customer@example.com',
    subject='Your AI-powered response',
    body='Thanks for reaching out!'
)
```

**Behind the scenes:** 🔧
We rebuilt our webhook delivery system for better reliability. Failed webhooks now retry with exponential backoff, and you can view delivery logs in the dashboard. The Python SDK uses the same battle-tested patterns as our Node.js SDK.

More language SDKs coming soon—Go and Ruby are next! Let us know what you need. 📨
