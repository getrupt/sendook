## Choose Your Path

Sendook offers two deployment options: **Cloud** (hosted by us) or **Self-Hosted** (on your infrastructure).

### Cloud Setup (Recommended for Getting Started)

The fastest way to get started. No infrastructure to manage.

#### 1. Sign Up

Create your free account at [app.sendook.com/signup](https://app.sendook.com/signup) - no credit card required.

#### 2. Get Your API Key

After signing up, navigate to your dashboard and create an API key:

1. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Copy your key (it won't be shown again!)
4. Store it securely as `SENDOOK_API_KEY`

#### 3. Install the SDK

Install the official SDK for your language:

```bash [Node.js]
npm install @sendook/node
```

#### 4. Verify Installation

Test your setup with a quick verification:

```javascript [Node.js]
import Sendook from '@sendook/node';

const sendook = new Sendook(process.env.SENDOOK_API_KEY);
```

That's it! You're ready to create inboxes and send emails.

### Self-Hosted Setup

For complete control over your infrastructure.

#### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- MongoDB 5.0+
- Node.js 18+ (for building)
- A domain for receiving emails

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sendook/sendook.git
cd sendook
```

#### 2. Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file with your configuration:

```bash
# MongoDB Connection
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/sendook

# Email Domain
DEFAULT_EMAIL_DOMAIN=yourdomain.com

# Email provider credentials
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-access-key-id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret-access-key
```

#### 3. Start with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This starts:
- Sendook API server
- MongoDB database

#### 4. Configure DNS Records

Add these DNS records to receive emails:

```text
MX    @    10 inbound-smtp.{your-aws-region}.amazonaws.com
TXT   _dmarc    "v=DMARC1; p=reject;"
```

For DKIM, generate keys and add the provided TXT record:

```bash
docker exec sendook npm run generate-dkim
```

#### 5. Create Your First Organization

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "email": "admin@yourdomain.com",
    "password": "secure-password",
  }'
```

#### 6. Get Your API Key

Log in to the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000` and create an API key.
