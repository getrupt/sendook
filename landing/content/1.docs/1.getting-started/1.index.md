Sendook is an open-source email infrastructure platform designed specifically for AI agents. Stop wrestling with Gmail APIs, AWS SES configuration, and MIME parsing. Start building intelligent email-powered agents in minutes.

## Why Sendook?

Traditional email setup for AI agents is painful:
- **Days of configuration**: DNS records, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, domain verification
- **Complex APIs**: Gmail OAuth flows, SES credential management, API rate limits
- **Manual parsing**: MIME decoding, attachment handling, thread management
- **Infrastructure overhead**: Polling for emails, webhook setup, storage management

Sendook eliminates all of this complexity with a simple, API-first approach.

## Key Features

Everything your AI agent needs to communicate via email:

- **Instant Inbox Creation**: One API call creates a fully functional inbox. No DNS, no domain setup.
- **Real-time Webhooks**: Get notified the moment emails arrive. No polling required.
- **JSON-Ready Emails**: Pre-decoded, formatted emails with parsed attachments. Ready for consumption.
- **Send & Reply**: Simple APIs for sending emails and replying to threads. Threading handled automatically.
- **Full-Text Search**: Query emails by any field. Your agent's perfect memory.
- **Multi-Inbox Support**: Create unlimited inboxes. One per customer, use case, or department.
- **Custom Domains**: Use your own domains with automatic SPF/DKIM/DMARC setup.
- **Open Source**: MIT licensed. Self-host or use our cloud. Complete transparency.

## Quick Start

Get started in under 5 minutes:

```bash
# Install the SDK
npm install @sendook/node

# Create an inbox and send your first email
import Sendook from '@sendook/node';

const client = new Sendook(process.env.SENDOOK_API_KEY);

// Create an inbox
const inbox = await client.inbox.create({
  name: 'My AI Agent Inbox'
});

// Send an email
await client.inbox.message.send({
  inboxId: inbox.id,
  to: 'customer@example.com',
  subject: 'Hello from my AI agent',
  body: 'This email was sent via Sendook!'
});
```
