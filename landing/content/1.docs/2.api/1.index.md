The Sendook REST API powers everything you can do from the dashboard and SDKs. It uses predictable JSON payloads, standard HTTP verbs, and bearer token authentication so you can integrate from any language or runtime.

## Base URL

All requests start from the production base URL:

```text
https://api.sendook.com
```

> Development and self-hosted environments typically expose the same routes on your own domain. Replace the host while keeping the paths identical.

## Authentication

Pass your API key as a bearer token on every request:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

- Keys are managed in the dashboard or through the [API Keys endpoints](/docs/api/api-keys).
- Treat API keys like passwords—store them securely and rotate regularly.

### Example request

```bash
curl https://api.sendook.com/v1/inboxes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SENDOOK_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Request & response format

- Request bodies use JSON unless otherwise noted.
- Successful responses include standard HTTP status codes (`200`, `201`, `202`, `204`).
- Collection endpoints return objects with a `data` array.
- Timestamp fields use ISO 8601 strings in UTC (for example `2024-05-01T12:00:00Z`).

## Error handling

Errors return an `application/json` payload with the following schema:

```json
{
  "message": "Human readable message",
  "code": "machine_readable_code",
  "details": {
    "...": "Additional diagnostic context"
  }
}
```

### Example error

```json
{
  "message": "Authentication token is invalid or expired.",
  "code": "auth_invalid_token",
  "details": {
    "requestId": "req_abc123"
  }
}
```

Retryable errors (5xx) are rare but can occur during network turbulence; follow standard exponential backoff practices.
