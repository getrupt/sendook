## Webhook payload format

When an event occurs, Sendook sends a `POST` request to your webhook URL with the following payload structure:

```json
{
  "event": "message.received",
  "inboxId": "ibox_01J3ZKZ0BRQ9SSJK1GRSCX4N4Z",
  "messageId": "msg_01J3ZN9SB2M5MHF5C2QBP4DT78",
  "payload": {
    // Event-specific payload data
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `event` | string | The event type that triggered the webhook. |
| `inboxId` | string | The inbox ID associated with the event (if applicable). |
| `messageId` | string | The message ID associated with the event (if applicable). |
| `payload` | object | Event-specific data containing the full resource details. |

### Example webhook payload

For a `message.received` event:

```json
{
  "event": "message.received",
  "inboxId": "ibox_01J3ZKZ0BRQ9SSJK1GRSCX4N4Z",
  "messageId": "msg_01J3ZN9SB2M5MHF5C2QBP4DT78",
  "payload": {
    "id": "msg_01J3ZN9SB2M5MHF5C2QBP4DT78",
    "subject": "Welcome to Sendook",
    "text": "Plain text version of the email.",
    "html": "<p>HTML version of the email.</p>",
    "labels": ["inbound"],
    "createdAt": "2024-10-10T19:22:10Z"
  }
}
```

## Webhook delivery

- Webhooks are sent via `POST` requests to your configured URL.
- Your endpoint should respond with a `2xx` status code to acknowledge receipt.
- Failed deliveries may be retried automatically.
- Ensure your endpoint is accessible via HTTPS and responds within 15 seconds.

> Tip: Use the test endpoint to verify your webhook configuration before relying on it for production events.
